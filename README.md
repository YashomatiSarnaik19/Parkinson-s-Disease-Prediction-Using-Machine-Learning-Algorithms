# Parkinson's-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive central nervous system disorder characterized by tremors, vocal cord disorders, bradykinesia, and slurred, slow speech. After Alzheimer's disease, it is the second most prevalent neurological disorder. Approximately 6.3 million people worldwide are affected by this disease. It is caused by the death of dopamine-producing neurons and primarily affects those over the age of 60. Parkinson's disease does not have a cure, but early detection may be able to slow the disease's progression. Using speech analysis data, researchers have spent the past few years working on the detection and monitoring of Parkinson's disease. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are gaining popularity because they can automate the process of accurate pattern recognition. Approximately 90% of patients with PD suffer from motor impairments. Then, datasets are obtained and examined to determine if the individual has Parkinson's disease. 
Here in this project I have used several ML Algorithms like KNN, XG_Boost Classifier, Random_Forest Classifier and Support Vector Classifier to predict the disease.
